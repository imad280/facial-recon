# facial-recon
In this repository you will find a project of facial recognition that I have worked on leveraging machine and deep learning techniques. <br>The "Yale Faces" dataset is the one that has been used for the training in this project. I've implemented the preprocessing pipeline with OpenCV.

<b>Key Features:</b>
<ul>

<li><b></b>Data Preparation:</b> Preprocessing of the images in "Yale Faces" dataset ensuring it's ready for model training.</li>
<li><b>Machine Learning:</b> Modelization and fine-tuning of the model.</li>
<li><b>Deep Learning Architecture:</b> Another modelization for facial recognition using DL this time.</li>
<li><b>Evaluation Metrics:</b> Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.</li>
</ul>
